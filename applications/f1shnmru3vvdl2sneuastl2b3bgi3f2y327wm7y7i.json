    "Brief history of your project and organization": "CMIP began in 1995 under the auspices of the Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM). The first set of common experiments involved comparing the model response to an idealized forcing â€“ a constant rate of increase which was accomplished using a CO2 increase of 1% per year compounded.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Zarr formatted data and Netcdf formatted data. The sixth phase of global coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model ensemble.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "Use lotus to prepare data into car files. We will choose sps with enough token and technical support.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://cmip6-pds/\r\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://esgf-world/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Sporadic",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "2 to 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives, Lotus built-in data transfer, Others",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f02128256 Toronto\r\nf02196792 HongKong\r\nf02029743 Singapore\r\nf02363999 Singapore\r\nf02368314 Deyang",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
