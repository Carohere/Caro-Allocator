    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The mission of Allen Institute is to understand and predict cell behaviors.\r\nCZ CELLxGENE Discover (cellxgene.cziscience.com) is a free-to-use platform for the exploration, analysis, and retrieval of single-cell data. CZ CELLxGENE Discover hosts the largest aggregation of standardized single-cell data from the major human and mouse tissues, with modalities that include gene expression, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and spatial transcriptomics.\r\nGeoNet is the result of a partnership between Natural Hazards Commission Toka TÅ« Ake, GNS Science, and Land Information New Zealand (LINZ). The GeoNet project was established in 2001 to build and operate a modern geological hazard monitoring system in New Zealand. It comprises a network of geophysical instruments, automated software applications and skilled staff to detect, analyse and respond to earthquakes, volcanic activity, large landslides, tsunami and the slow deformation that precedes large earthquakes.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "This bucket contains multiple datasets (as Quilt packages) created by the Allen Institute for Cell Science.\r\nHuman and mouse RNA single-cell data\r\nGeoNet provides geological hazard information for Aotearoa New Zealand. This dataset contains data and products recorded by the GeoNet sensor network.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We are a technical team with the ability to prepare data. We use lotus to prepare data.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://allencell/\r\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://cellxgene-census-public-us-west-2/cell-census/\r\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://geonet-open-data/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Monthly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "2 to 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, South America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives, Lotus built-in data transfer",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03241837, Zhejiang\r\nf03216485, Sichuan\r\nf03100004, Guangdong\r\nf03214920, HongKong\r\nf03231666, Sichuan",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
