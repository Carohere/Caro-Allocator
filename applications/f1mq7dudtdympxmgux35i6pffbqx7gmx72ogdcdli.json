    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The Cell Painting Gallery is a collection of image datasets created using the Cell Painting assay. The images of cells are captured by microscopy imaging, and reveal the response of various labeled cell components to whatever treatments are tested, which can include genetic perturbations, chemicals or drugs, or different cell types. The datasets can be used for diverse applications in basic biology and pharmaceutical research, such as identifying disease-associated phenotypes, understanding disease mechanisms, and predicting a drugâ€™s activity, toxicity, or mechanism of action (Chandrasekaran et al 2020).",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Cell Painting data, comprising fluorescence microscopy cell images (TIFF), extracted features (CSV), and associated metadata (CSV and TXT).",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "Lotus is our first choice to prepare data.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "s3://cellpainting-gallery/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Shipping hard drives, Lotus built-in data transfer",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "1. f01660795, Guangdong\n2. f03156722, HongKong\n3. f03100004, Shenzhen\n4. f03231666, Sichuan\n5. f03241837, Shanghai\n6. f02851143, Luzhou\n7. f03099981, Hongkong\n8. f03233333, Jiangmen\n9. f03325538, HongKong\n10. f01313, HongKong\n11. f03408862, India\n12. f01730296, HongKong",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
