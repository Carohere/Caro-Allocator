    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The NOAA Satellite and Information Service provides timely access to global environmental data from satellites and other sources to monitor and understand our dynamic Earth. We manage the Nation's operational environmental satellites and deliver data and information services such as Earth system monitoring and official assessments of the environment.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "GOES satellites (GOES-16, GOES-17, & GOES-18) provide continuous weather imagery and monitoring of meteorological and space environment data across North America. GOES satellites provide the kind of continuous monitoring necessary for intensive data analysis. They hover continuously over one position on the surface. The satellites orbit high enough to allow for a full-disc view of the Earth. Because they stay above a fixed spot on the surface, they provide a constant vigil for the atmospheric \"triggers\" for severe weather conditions such as tornadoes, flash floods, hailstorms, and hurricanes. When these conditions develop, the GOES satellites are able to monitor storm development and track their movements. SUVI products available in both NetCDF and FITS.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We choose lotus to convert this dataset into car files. When we cooperate with sps, we will send hard ships to sps for data transfering. We'd like to help spread useful data.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "These are a series of datasets.\r\ns3://noaa-goes18/\r\ns3://noaa-goes16/\r\ns3://noaa-goes17/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "2 to 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f02252118 HK\r\nf02211576 DG\r\nf01927410 DA\r\nf0420161 CA\r\nf02244750 LD",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
