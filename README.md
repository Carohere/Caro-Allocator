### 🫵You need to do

1. Submit an application in https://github.com/Carohere/Caro-Allocator/issues
2. Finish my survey and provide information of KYB/KYC
3. Provide ≥5 sps in different regions with good retrieval and update it when there's any change
4. Make your data sample match with the dataset you want to store

### 👐We will do

1. We provide training and technical support services to new clients
2. Check your KYB/KYC information
3. Verify that the data requested is consistent with what is outlined in the sample description.
4. Audit your cid report in your storage process

### 🗒️Allocation tranche schedule

* First allocation max 5%

* Second allocation max 10%

* Third allocation max 15%
           
* Fourth allocation max 20%

* Fifth and there after max 25%
  
And no allocation can be bigger than 2x of the previous one. 

### ⚠️Risk mitigation approach

If we find that the client has broken the rules, we will immediately suspend the cooperation and ask the client to correct the problem. If the client is found to break the rules several times, the cooperation will be ended.

### ⚖️Dispute resolution process

When I have a dispute, I will first contact the client involved in the dispute and create a proposal on github to record the subsequent process of handling the dispute. I will allow 5 days for feedback to provide options for dealing with the dispute. Disputes are publicly available on github for 14 days, and community members can provide opinions on disputes via github, slack, and email.

The results of the dispute will be posted on github, and I will take action to punish the wrong side of the dispute. For example, stop cooperation, ask the client to change SP, etc.
